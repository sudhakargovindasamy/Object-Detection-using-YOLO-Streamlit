# 🧿 Object Detection using YOLO + Streamlit

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using the **YOLO model** integrated with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.  
The app allows users to upload images/videos, run object detection, and visualize results directly in the browser.

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies:
```
numpy
opencv-python
pandas
pillow
requests
streamlit
ultralytics
```

Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Object-Detection.git
cd Object-Detection
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run Object_Detection.ipynb
```

The app will open locally at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🌍 Hosting with Ngrok

1. Create a free Ngrok account: [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)  
2. Sign up and copy your Auth Token  
3. Authenticate Ngrok:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
4. Run your Streamlit app with Ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 8501
```
5. Copy the public URL generated by Ngrok and share it.

## 🎨 Changing Background Image

1. Search Google for “free image hosting site” (e.g., ImgBB or Postimages)  
2. Upload your desired image  
3. Open the image in a new tab → Copy the direct image URL  
4. Replace the URL in your code:
```python
background_url = "https://your-uploaded-image-link.com/image.png"
```

## 📊 Sample Output

- Detect objects in uploaded images  
- Run YOLO detection on uploaded videos  
- Customize UI background  

---

## ✅ Results

- Successful detection of objects in real-time  
- YOLO provides fast and accurate predictions  
- Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit  

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Extend to live camera feed detection  
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces  
- Add options for model selection (YOLOv8 variants)
